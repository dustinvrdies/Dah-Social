# DAH Social

## Overview
DAH Social is a purely frontend social media platform built with React and Vite. It leverages `localStorage` for all data persistence, eliminating the need for a backend. The platform integrates features inspired by Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn, focusing on content discovery, social interaction, and user-generated content. Key capabilities include a social feed (text, video, listings), a marketplace ("DAH Mall"), customizable user profiles, a virtual currency system ("DAH Coins"), follow/notification systems, native ads, direct messaging, and an extensive gaming section with an AI game creator. The project aims to provide a rich, dark-themed social experience with a strong emphasis on user engagement and rewarding content creation.
